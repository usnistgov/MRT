## Configuration files for misc command line things

These are files to configure some things nicely. This only matters during development when the commandline is actually used. These files go into the users home directory.
- **.bashrc** bash configuration things. Most importantly color
- **.vimrc** configuration for vim for nice defaults (numbering, syntax, etc)
- **.Xresources** Set xterm to have a black background
