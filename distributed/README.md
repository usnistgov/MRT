## Distributed MRT configuration files

These files are used to configure a Linux machine to do distributed MRT tests. They may not all be needed if a non dedicated MRT setup is used.  Testing was done on a pi 3 inside a pi-top 3, most of the files here are widely applicable to any Linux system or not needed. For the setup Arch Linux was used.
